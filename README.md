# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Lab

This project is a demonstration of my ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets. The analysis focuses on a used car dataset and is designed to showcase my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Project Overview

In this lab, I:
- **Cleaned and Preprocessed Data:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats.
- **Explored the Dataset:** Generated descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.
- **Identified Key Insights:** Derived actionable insights regarding pricing, car features, and market trends in the used car market.

## Dataset

- **Filename:** `usedcar.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains information on used cars including features such as price, mileage, year, and other relevant attributes.
